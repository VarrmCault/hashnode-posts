### [DevToys](https://devtoys.app/)

**DevToys** present themselves as a "swiss army knife" and that's exactly what they are. They offer a large range of tools to make your development easier. From format tools to generators (UUID, Lorem ipsum, ...) and encoders/decoders, it is very likely that whatever tool you need will be in there.

The downside is that it is only for Windows users. [You can download it directly from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/devtoys/9PGCV4V3BK4W?hl=en-us&gl=us) and use it offline.

### [Allinone.tools](https://allinone.tools/en) / [IT Tools](https://it-tools.tech/) / [Omatsuri](https://omatsuri.app/)

If you are not a Windows user and can't benefit from DevToys or if you didn't find that one specific tool you always use, there are plenty of similar tools online you can try.

**Allinone.tools** is one of them and is probably one of the most complete tool list you can find. They offer almost everything that DevToys contains - which is already a lot, plus many other useful tools (image converters, PDF tools, social media generators, ...).

If you find Allinone.tools too busy you can also use **IT Tools** which contains a smaller set of tools but still plenty enough to find what you need.

And last but not least, you can have a look at **Omatsuri**. Their toolbox is quite reduced compared to all of the websites mentioned above but you will find handy cheatsheets (symbols to copy/paste with their HTML and CSS codes, CSS cursors and keyboard event codes). My favorite Omatsuri tool is the [Fake data generator](https://omatsuri.app/fake-data-generator) that you can use to generate a realistic dataset of custom JSON objects.

### [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)

Mockoon allows you to easily mock all of your API endpoints. Every endpoint can be configured with multiple responses and latency to emulate a real client-server interaction. You can select a default response for your endpoint and configure rules based on request parameters and other criteria to select another one.

Mockoon is a desktop application that works offline and does not require creating an account. You can configure the ports used to run each mocked API and export your documentation to OpenAPI format.

### [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler)

**Fiddler Classic** is an enhanced version of your browser's Network tab. It is a desktop application that registers all of the HTTP traffic across your browsers/tabs/command line applications and lets you inspect the requests just like the Network tab. I have to confess that I only used Fiddler to inspect closely some requests I couldn't catch in my devtools and I didn't explore all of the options available through Fiddler.

Fiddler Classic is only available for Windows users as a desktop application.

### [Airtest](https://www.airtest.dev/)

**Airtest** is an app that helps you generate unit tests using AI. They support many languages and a few testing frameworks for each language. I've only tested it with a couple of Typescript functions and it generated meaningful tests with Jest framework. It might not be enough for more complex applications but you can get in a matter of seconds many well-made tests for your basic use cases. If you are a beginner in unit testing with a specific framework, this is a great way to learn how to write tests and all of the available functions you can use.

### [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/)

**InVision** allows you to create giant collaborative whiteboards called "Freehands". Each whiteboard comes with basic tools (text, drawing tools, notes, comments) but they also offer a few other options. The one I wanted to talk about in this article is their wireframe toolset:

This is an example of a wireframe I built with InVision to illustrate this article; it took me less than a couple of minutes to build those drafts thanks to all of the premade components. They also offer separate smaller components (icons, buttons, navigation bars and so on) that you can use to quickly build any mock-up.

As it is a collaborative tool, anyone in your workspace can join and interact with the whiteboard at the same time. The freehands also include Kanban boards, documentation pages with basic markdown support, and various integrations (JIRA, Asana, Figma, Google Docs, ...).

InVision offers paid plans to build different types of collaborative documents, but you can create as many freehands as you want for free.
