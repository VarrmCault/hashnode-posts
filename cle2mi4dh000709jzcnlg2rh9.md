# Improve your developer skills with these websites

I write this article to share two useful websites that you can use to improve your skills in whatever language you like or use.

### Exercism

Let's start with [Exercism](https://exercism.org/dashboard).

As advertised by their banner, Exercism offers exercises for **plenty of languages**. They obviously have exercises for all the well-known languages like Java, C, C#, Javascript or Typescript, but also for more random languages like Prolog, Fortran, Assembly and a lot of languages that I even never heard of.

They use what they call "tracks" to, well, track your progress in the languages you choose. Some of them have a **learning mode** that introduces you to the basics of the language :

Both the languages with a learning mode and the ones without have a consequent list of exercises sorted by difficulty:

Note that most of the exercises are the same in the different language tracks. Because the community can submit exercises, you'll also find exercises that are specific to a track.

Exercism is the **perfect website for beginners** who'd like to **learn the concepts** of a language with accessible exercises.

More advanced developers might have some challenges as well with some of the harder exercises, and they can also choose to **mentor** new developers. Beginners can indeed **ask for a mentoring session** on an exercise they already solved to have some insights on how they can improve their solutions or have explanations on things they don't understand.

Bonus points for the very clean UI.

### CodinGame

I believe [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) is certainly known by every developer who looked for a site to improve their skills.

In CodinGame you won't have a track per language but instead a general track of skills across all the languages - it doesn't matter if you solved the puzzles in Typescript, Java or PHP.

Completing puzzles will give you XP and various skills:

Each puzzle has a language dropdown to let you choose the language you want to use to solve this puzzle. You'll have the choice between a **large range of languages** so don't worry, you'll probably find the one you want to practice.

Just like on Exercism, you will find puzzles sorted by difficulty, from ***Easy* to *Very hard***. Let's be honest though: CodinGame's puzzles are way harder than the exercises on Exercism. For this reason, I think that CodinGame is a **better fit for intermediate and advanced developers** and isn't super beginner-friendly.

As far as I know, there is no mentoring on CodingGame, you can go through the community-shared solutions but you can't directly ask for insights on your own solution.

CodinGame also has cool features:

* **Multiplayer activities.** Among them is a challenge called "Clash of code": you and other developers will try and find a solution to a short puzzle at the same time. There are public clashes you can join or you can create a private one to play with friends or coworkers.
    
* **Free language certifications**. Because CodinGame has a good reputation, you can get certified through a 60 minutes test and share this certification on your resume. It is a way to stand out to recruiters with a concrete assessment of your technical skills.
